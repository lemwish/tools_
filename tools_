sudo apt-get install dkms

add the above command to add it to my repository

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian precise contrib" >>
 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list'

update repo
sudo apt-get update


virtualbox-4.3_4.3.6-91406~Ubuntu~precise_amd64.deb

sudo apt-get install virtualbox-4.3

sudo apt-get install     virtualbox-4.3_4.3.6-91406~Ubuntu~precise_amd64.deb

To automatically mount the drives on boot, install mountmanager by typing
sudo apt-get install mountmanager

To mount the drives right now, type sudo mount /dev/sdaX, where X is the number of the partion to mount. 


# yum install oracle-rdbms-server-11gR2-preinstall
Note. Probably you will not be able to paste and copy this command. So you will have to type it manually. We are going to fix that shortly by installing Guest Additions. For now just type those commands.
Install ASMLib:
# yum install oracleasm
# yum install oracleasm-support

Create the directory in which the Oracle software will be installed.
mkdir -p  /u01
chown -R oracle:oinstall /u01
chmod -R 775 /u01/

Add oracle account to dba and vboxsf groups. The vboxsf group was created by VirtualBox Guest Additions and will allow oracle user access folders in the Host OS:
# usermod -G dba,vboxsf oracle

Reset oracle user password to oracle:
# passwd oracle

Disable secure linux by editing the "/etc/selinux/config" file, making sure the SELINUX flag is set as follows.
SELINUX=disabled

Either configure NTP, or make sure it is not configured so the Oracle Cluster Time Synchronization Service (ctssd) can synchronize the times of the RAC nodes. In this case we will deconfigure NTP.
# service ntpd stop
Shutting down ntpd:                                        [FAILED]
# chkconfig ntpd off
# mv /etc/ntp.conf /etc/ntp.conf.orig
# rm /var/run/ntpd.pid
